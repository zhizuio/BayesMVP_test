\title{expected log pointwise predictive density}
\usage{
elpd(object, method = "LOO")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{BayesMVP}}

\item{method}{the name of the prediction accuracy index. Default is the
\code{"LOO"} (Bayesian LOO estimate of out-of-sample predictive fit). The
other index is the \code{"WAIC"} (widely applicable information criterion).
For the HRR models, both "\code{LOO}" and "\code{WAIC}" are computed based
on the multivate t-distribution of the posterior predictive rather than
approximation of importance sampling.}
}
\value{
Return the predictiion accuracy measure from an object of class
\code{BayesMVP}. It is elpd.loo if the argumnet \code{method="LOO"} and
elpd.WAIC if \code{method="WAIC"}.
}
\description{
Measure the prediction accuracy by the elpd (expected log pointwise
predictive density). The out-of-sample predictive fit can either be
estimated by Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) or by widely
applicable information criterion (WAIC) (Vehtari et al. 2017).
